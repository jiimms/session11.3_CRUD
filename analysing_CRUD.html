When Rails generate a scaffold, it creates a new resource with the name supplied in the 'generate scaffold' command. 
We can create, read, update and destroy items for this resource and 
these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.

CRUD:
Create new records in the database
Read or show the records in the database
Update existing records
Destroy or delete records.

In the controller generated by scaffold, these actions
 are automatically included.
