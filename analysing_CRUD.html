<p>When Rails generate a scaffold, it creates a new resource. <br>We can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.</p>

<p>CRUD:<br>
Create new records in the database<br>
Read or show the records in the database<br>
Update existing records<br>
Destroy or delete records.<br>

In the controller generated by scaffold, these actions are automatically included.</p>
