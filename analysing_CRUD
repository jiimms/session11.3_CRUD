When Rails generate a scaffold, it creates a new resource. We can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations.

CRUD:
Create new records in the database
Read or show the records in the database
Update existing records
Destroy or delete records.

In the controller generated by scaffold, these actions are automatically included.
